# antennaGUI
A simple GUI which will return information about antenna performance from given parameters

Dan, hopefully you have managed to access this.

I have had a few thoughts about how to proceed.  As you are stronger at programming I thought you might be quicker than me at creating an empty GUI. At the same time, I will create some functions which take in and return various parameters.

Anyway, just a thought.  If you can read/edit this, then we have made a good start.  We need to have a think and come up with a plan.

I could also do with some software which takes in text files and creates a graph.  If you have any code or experience of this, let me know.
